# File Persistence Fix Analysis

## Root Cause
The file upload system has two separate data stores:
1. **pinFiles** state - stores actual File objects locally (not persisted)
2. **pinFileMetadata** state - stores file metadata from Supabase (should persist)

## The Problem Flow:
1. User uploads file → Saves to Supabase storage ✅
2. File metadata saved to `pin_files` table ✅
3. File metadata added to `pinFileMetadata` state ✅
4. File object added to `pinFiles` state (for backward compatibility) ✅
5. User logs out → State cleared ✅
6. User logs in → Pins loaded from Supabase ✅
7. **BUG**: `loadPinFiles` runs but depends on pins array being populated
8. **BUG**: The file count shows `pinFiles[id]?.length` which is the local File objects, not the persisted metadata

## The Fix:
We need to change the UI to show `pinFileMetadata[id]?.length` instead of `pinFiles[id]?.length` for the file count, since pinFileMetadata is what gets loaded from Supabase.

## Implementation:
