# Notification Archive Feature

## Features Added

‚úÖ **Mark as Read Button**: Each notification now has an Archive button (üìÅ icon) that marks notifications as read and moves them to archive
‚úÖ **Archive Functionality**: Notifications are marked as read and archived when users click the "Mark as Read" button
‚úÖ **UI Updates**: Added Archive button next to Delete button in notification dropdown
‚úÖ **Service Methods**: Added archiving methods to notification service
‚úÖ **Badge Updates**: Badge count excludes archived notifications

## Database Migration Required

To fully enable the archive functionality, you need to add the `is_archived` column to your notifications table:

### Step 1: Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add archived column to notifications table
ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN is_archived boolean DEFAULT false;

-- Create index for better query performance  
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_notifications_user_archived ON notifications(user_id, is_archived);
```

### Step 2: Verify the feature

1. The app will work without the column (it will just mark notifications as read)
2. After adding the column, notifications will be properly archived
3. Archived notifications won't appear in the main notification list
4. Badge count will exclude archived notifications

## How It Works

1. **Without `is_archived` column**: The Archive button will just mark notifications as read
2. **With `is_archived` column**: The Archive button will mark notifications as read AND archived
3. **Archive behavior**: Archived notifications are hidden from the main notification view but still exist in the database
4. **Badge count**: Only shows unread, unarchived notifications

## User Experience

- Users see an Archive button (üìÅ) and Delete button (üóëÔ∏è) on each notification
- Clicking Archive marks the notification as read and removes it from view
- Clicking Delete permanently removes the notification
- The notification badge only shows unread, non-archived notifications

## Future Enhancements

- Add "View Archived" section to see archived notifications
- Add bulk archive/unarchive functionality
- Add archive date tracking
