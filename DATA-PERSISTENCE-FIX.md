# Data Persistence Issue Fix

## Problem Summary

Users were experiencing a critical data persistence issue where:
1. They upload data to a pin
2. They log out
3. When they log back in, the data in the pin is no longer visible

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, I identified multiple interconnected issues:

### 1. **RLS Policy Type Mismatch** (Critical)
The RLS policies had inconsistent UUID comparison patterns:
- Some policies used: `user_id::text = auth.uid()` (comparing text with UUID)
- Others used: `auth.uid() = user_id` (comparing UUID with UUID)

This type mismatch caused RLS policies to fail silently, preventing users from accessing their own data after re-authentication.

### 2. **Overly Permissive Pin Files RLS Policies** (Security Issue)
The `pin_files` table had RLS policies that allowed unrestricted access:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own pin files" ON public.pin_files
    FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

This meant no actual user-based filtering was happening for file access.

### 3. **Missing User Access Validation in File Storage Service**
The `file-storage-service.ts` methods didn't validate user ownership of pins before allowing file operations.

### 4. **Inconsistent Authentication Error Handling**
Authentication checks in various services lacked proper error handling and user validation.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Fixed RLS Policies** (`fix-rls-policies.sql`)
- âœ… Standardized all RLS policies to use consistent UUID comparison: `auth.uid() = user_id`
- âœ… Implemented proper user-based access control for `pin_files` table
- âœ… Ensured all junction tables properly validate user ownership through parent records
- âœ… Added comprehensive policies for all tables (projects, tags, pins, lines, areas, pin_files)

### 2. **Enhanced File Storage Service** (`src/lib/supabase/file-storage-service.ts`)
- âœ… Added user authentication checks to all file operations
- âœ… Implemented pin ownership verification before file uploads/downloads/deletions
- âœ… Added proper error handling and logging
- âœ… Ensured RLS policies work in conjunction with application-level security

### 3. **Improved Authentication Handling** (`src/lib/supabase/map-data-service.ts`)
- âœ… Enhanced error handling for authentication failures
- âœ… Added detailed logging for debugging authentication issues
- âœ… Improved user session validation

## Files Modified

### Database/SQL Files:
- ðŸ“„ `fix-rls-policies.sql` - Comprehensive RLS policy fixes
- ðŸ“„ `apply-data-persistence-fix.js` - Automated fix application script

### Application Code:
- ðŸ“„ `src/lib/supabase/file-storage-service.ts` - Enhanced user access validation
- ðŸ“„ `src/lib/supabase/map-data-service.ts` - Improved authentication handling

## How to Apply the Fix

### Method 1: Automated (Recommended)
```bash
node apply-data-persistence-fix.js
```

### Method 2: Manual
1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Execute the entire contents of `fix-rls-policies.sql`
3. Verify all policies are created successfully

## Testing the Fix

After applying the fix, test the data persistence by:

1. **Create a pin with data:**
   - Log into the application
   - Create a new pin on the map
   - Upload data/files to the pin
   - Verify the data is visible

2. **Test persistence:**
   - Log out of the application
   - Clear browser cache/cookies (optional but thorough)
   - Log back in
   - Navigate to the pin location
   - **Verify the pin and all uploaded data are still visible**

3. **Test across different browsers/devices:**
   - Log in from a different browser
   - Verify you can see your pins and data
   - Log in from a mobile device
   - Confirm data persistence

## Technical Details

### RLS Policy Structure
The fixed policies follow this pattern:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own pins" ON pins
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own pin files" ON pin_files
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM pins WHERE pins.id = pin_files.pin_id AND pins.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### File Access Validation
```typescript
// Before any file operation, verify user owns the pin
const { data: pinData, error: pinError } = await this.supabase
  .from('pins')
  .select('id, user_id')
  .eq('id', pinId)
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .single()

if (pinError || !pinData) {
  console.error('Pin not found or user does not have access:', pinError)
  return null
}
```

## Expected Outcomes

After applying this fix:
- âœ… Pin data will persist across logout/login cycles
- âœ… File uploads will be properly associated with authenticated users
- âœ… Users will only see their own data (proper data isolation)
- âœ… Security is enhanced with proper access control
- âœ… Error handling is improved for better debugging

## Monitoring

To monitor the fix effectiveness:
1. Check application logs for authentication errors
2. Monitor database logs for RLS policy violations
3. Test data persistence regularly with different user accounts
4. Verify no cross-user data access occurs

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, the previous RLS policies can be restored by:
1. Dropping the new policies
2. Recreating the original policies from the migration files
3. However, this would restore the data persistence bug

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Regular Testing**: Implement automated tests for data persistence
2. **Monitoring**: Add application-level monitoring for data access patterns
3. **Documentation**: Keep RLS policies documented and version controlled
4. **Security Audits**: Regularly review RLS policies for security gaps
