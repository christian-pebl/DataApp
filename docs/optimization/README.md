## üéØ Optimization Priorities

### üî¥ High Priority (Implement First)
1. **Logger System** - Low risk, high benefit
   - Single file implementation
   - Easy to test and roll back
   - Improves debugging experience

2. **Testing Infrastructure** - Foundation for safety
   - No code changes required
   - Enables safer future changes
   - Quick to implement

### üü° Medium Priority (Implement After Testing)
3. **Console.log Migration** - Medium risk
   - Depends on logger system
   - Requires testing but low impact
   - Can be done incrementally

4. **LeafletMap Improvements** - Medium risk
   - Type safety improvements
   - Z-index ordering fixes
   - Isolated to one component

### üî¥ High Risk (Requires Database Changes)
5. **Type System Updates** - HIGH RISK
   - Requires database migration
   - Breaking changes if not done carefully
   - Must test thoroughly

6. **Data Explorer Overhaul** - HIGH RISK
   - Large surface area
   - New features untested
   - Dependencies on type system

7. **Service Layer Refactors** - HIGH RISK
   - Core functionality changes
   - Hard to test without full app
   - May have cascading effects

## üìù How to Use This Documentation

### Starting a New Optimization

1. **Review Existing Docs**
   ```bash
   # List all optimization docs
   ls -la docs/optimization/

   # Search for specific topics
   grep -r "logger" docs/optimization/
   ```

2. **Check for Incomplete Work**
   - Look for files marked ‚ö†Ô∏è INCOMPLETE
   - Review [Known Issues](#known-issues) sections
   - Check [Testing Checklists](#testing-checklist)

3. **Learn from Past Mistakes**
   - Read "Lessons Learned" sections
   - Review "What Went Wrong" sections
   - Follow recommended workflows

### Implementing Past Optimizations

1. **Choose a Section**
   - Start with high-priority, low-risk items
   - Read the entire section first
   - Check dependencies

2. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b optimization/logger-system
   ```

3. **Implement Incrementally**
   - Make small changes
   - Test frequently
   - Commit working code

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Mark sections as implemented
   - Document issues found
   - Add test results

## üß™ Testing Standards

All optimization work should follow these testing standards:

### Before Implementation
- [ ] Read full documentation section
- [ ] Understand dependencies
- [ ] Check for database changes needed
- [ ] Review known issues

### During Implementation
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Make small, testable changes
- [ ] Run `npm run typecheck` frequently
- [ ] Test manually after each change
- [ ] Commit working code

### Before Merging
- [ ] All type errors resolved
- [ ] Manual testing complete
- [ ] Unit tests written (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed

## üìä Optimization Metrics

### Code Quality Improvements
- **Logger System**: 52+ files migrated to structured logging
- **Type Safety**: Type definitions consolidated and improved
- **Error Handling**: Structured error handling throughout

### Technical Debt Reduction
- **Removed**: Firebase package (unused)
- **Added**: Testing infrastructure
- **Improved**: Service layer architecture

### Known Issues Created
- **Database Schema**: 12 new fields need migration
- **Turbopack**: Disabled (reason unclear)
- **Data Overview**: Disabled section needs decision
