# File Persistence Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Identified
Files uploaded to pins were not persisting after logout/login. Root cause: UI was displaying file count from local state (pinFiles) instead of database state (pinFileMetadata).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed File Count Display (page.tsx lines 1816-1819)
```javascript
// BEFORE: Only showed local files
const fileCount = pinFiles[itemToEdit.id]?.length || 0;

// AFTER: Shows both local and database files
const localFileCount = pinFiles[itemToEdit.id]?.length || 0;
const dbFileCount = pinFileMetadata[itemToEdit.id]?.length || 0;
const fileCount = localFileCount + dbFileCount;
```

### 2. Fixed File Selection Dropdown (handleFileTypeSelection function)
Updated to combine files from both sources:
- Local files from pinFiles state
- Database files from pinFileMetadata state
- Converts metadata to File-like objects for consistent handling

### 3. UI Improvements
- Dropdown stays open after file upload for immediate visual feedback
- File count turns green when files are present
- Users can immediately see and access uploaded files

## Verification Status
