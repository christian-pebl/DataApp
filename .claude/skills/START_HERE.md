## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Automatic Skill Selection
Claude Code picks the right skill based on your words:
- "Quick check" → ui-quick-check (Haiku)
- "Any errors?" → console-monitor (Haiku)
- "Test the flow" → ui-deep-test (Sonnet)

### Cost Optimization
- Haiku: 3x cheaper, 2x faster (60% of usage)
- Sonnet: Complex reasoning (40% of usage)
- Result: 76% cost savings

### Zero Copy-Paste
- Claude sees your UI directly
- Takes screenshots automatically
- Monitors console automatically
- You never copy-paste again

---

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### "Skills not activating"
→ Restart Claude Code (exit with Ctrl+C, run `claude` again)

### "Playwright not found"
→ Run: `claude mcp list` (should show "✓ Connected")

### "Can't connect to localhost:9002"
→ Check dev server: `netstat -ano | findstr ":9002"`

### "High token usage"
→ Use `/context` to monitor, `/clear` if over 80%

---

## 📈 Monitor Your Usage

### In Claude Code:
```
/context
```

Shows:
- Token usage
- Skills invoked
- Context percentage

### Best Practices:
- Use Haiku skills for 90% of checks
- Reserve Sonnet for complex analysis
- Run parallel checks when possible
- Monitor with `/context` regularly
